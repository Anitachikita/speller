# CS50 Problem Set 5: Speller

This project is a part of the Harvard CS50 Course (2023) and focuses on data structures and dictionaries. The goal of this problem set is to create a program called "Speller" that can spell-check a given file using a hash table.

## Programming Language: C

The project is implemented in the C programming language, which allows for low-level memory manipulation and efficient data structure implementations.

## Problem Set Description

In this problem set, we explore various data structures like hash tables, singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, tries, stacks, and queues. The task at hand is to build a program that can spell-check a text file by reading a dictionary file and comparing the words in the text file against the words in the dictionary. 

The "Speller" program utilizes a hash table data structure to efficiently store the dictionary words and perform fast lookups. It employs hash functions to map words to specific indexes in the hash table, enabling quick retrieval and insertion operations. By utilizing this data structure, the program can determine whether a given word is spelled correctly or not.
